I found the following bug on Carrefour page.
Carrefour is a supermarket.
On their website you can create a user and make purchases.

The 'Favoritos' section cannot be accessed from the link next to 'Mi Cuenta', but there are other ways to access it.
The other options work, so this bug is not blocking a functionality.
